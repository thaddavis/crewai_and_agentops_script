In this video we'll introduce 2 new tools coming out of the Agent development world

The 1st is CrewAI and the 2nd is AgentOps

CrewAI is a Multi-Agent framework and AgentOps is an Agent Observability tool

CrewAI is one of the leaders in their space as is AgentOps...

For reference, here's a list showing the leading open source multi-agent frameworks ordered by GitHub stars as of September 27th, 2024...

If there are companies you would have liked to see on these lists that were left out please leave a comment...

For the remainder of this walkthrough, we will show how YOU can use CrewAI w/ AgentOps in a "beginner friendly" way

- 1) First, we'll build a team of agents manually (and show how to add monitoring with AgentOps)
- 2) and then Second, we'll build a team of agents using the CrewAI CLI (and show how to add monitoring with AgentOps)

- If you DON'T want to code along, you will still learn how CrewAI and AgentOps works by watching this video ...
- BUT! If you DO want to code along tho, you'll need to install VSCode & Docker on your machine

ALL THE CODE PRESENTED IS LINKED IN THE DESCRIPTION

- Stay tuned till the end, where we task the 2nd team of agents we build with writing us a hit song that we'll actually make to see what it sounds like
