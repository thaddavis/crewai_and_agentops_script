## Update the `crew.py` file

Now that we have the updated config for our crew set up, let's connect it properly with our Crew Class in the `crew.py` file...

by making the following updates

let's reference the config like so...

- songwriter
- producer
- songwriting
- producing
- song.md

## Explain the updates

Zooming out, what we've done here is customize a project created with the CrewAI CLI to consist of a hit-making music duo (ie: an acclaimed songwriter & producer) specialized in writing #1 hit songs

## Cliffhanger

Before we kickoff our agents and have a hit on our hands, let's track our hitmaking crew with AgentOps to make sure we have a backup of the generated song in the cloud for future reference
