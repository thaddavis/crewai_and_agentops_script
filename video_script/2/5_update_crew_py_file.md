## Update the `crew.py` file

Now that we have our updated config, let's connect it properly with our Crew Class in the `crew.py` file...

by making the following updates

- songwriter
- producer
- songwriting
- producing
- song.md

## Explain the updates

Zooming out, what we've done here is create a standard CrewAI project with the CrewAI CLI and customized it for building a hit-making music duo of agents (consisting of an acclaimed songwriter & producer) that create #1 hit songs

## Cliffhanger

Before we kickoff our agents and have a hit on our hands, let's track our crew with AgentOps to make sure we have a backup of the generated song in the cloud for future reference
