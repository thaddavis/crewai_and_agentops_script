# SECOND APPROACH

We are now going build a crew of agents using the CrewAI command line interface (or CLI)...

After we set up our crew using the CrewAI CLI, we'll layer on AgentOps for monitoring them

The only software you'll need to install to follow along is Docker Desktop & VSCode plus a few VSCode extensions namely the

- the Docker extension (id: ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
- and the "Dev Containers" extension (id: ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

- Both these tools are FREE and include support for Mac, Windows, & Linux. Let me quickly show you how to install them on my Mac so you get a feel for how easy it was for me BUT if your experience is not as straightforward and you get stuck, leave a comment or try entering descriptions of your issues into Google or ChatGPT for help troubleshooting

- Regarding how to watch this video, I recommend a focused session of watching all the way to the end without stopping and then coming back to any confusing parts afterwards...

- Let's go!
