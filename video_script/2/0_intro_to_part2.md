# SECOND APPROACH

Now let's build a crew of agents with CrewAI using their officially recommended approach

aka let's use the CrewAI command line interface (or CLI)...

After we set up our crew of agents using the CrewAI CLI, we'll layer on AgentOps for monitoring them

The only software you need to follow along is Docker Desktop & VSCode plus a few VSCode extensions namely the

- the Docker extension (id: ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
- and the "Dev Containers" extension (id: ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
