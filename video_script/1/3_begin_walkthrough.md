# FIRST APPROACH

Let's create the following files & folders...

```
mkdir -p src/our_crew_of_agents
touch src/our_crew_of_agents/main.py 
```

When a file name ends in `.py` it indicates to us that it holds Python code...

<!--
In Python projects, you'll often see a file called "main.py"

In this video, `main.py` will be the file we run to launch our agents and give them tasks

For the beginners watching, it's important to tell you that when programming, we can call files, folders, and many aspects of the code we write whatever we like.

For example, we could name this file that launches our application `blah.py`

```
mv src/our_crew_of_agents/main.py src/our_crew_of_agents/blah.py
print("Telling my agents to do something...")
python blah.py
```

REMEMBER: explain the concept of the Python interpreter

For the beginners, names are just labels there are an infinite number of ways to label and organize code in a project.

In practice tho, so it's easier to understand, collaborate, and build with others, we follow conventions.

And these conventions, or standard practices, are learned over time through experience so be patient if you feel unfamiliar with what you're seeing...

Get to the end of the video and the come back to the confusing parts...
-->

So let's rename blah.py back to main.py as that is more conventional...

And make sure everything works...

`mv src/our_crew_of_agents/blah.py src/our_crew_of_agents/main.py`

TEST: `python src/our_crew_of_agents/main.py` âˆš

And everything works just the same...
