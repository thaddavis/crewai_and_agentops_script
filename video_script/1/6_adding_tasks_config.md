## Observe the error

- FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/code/src/our_crew_of_agents/config/tasks.yaml'

- In addition to configuring the agents in our crew, CrewAI requires us to specify a file called `tasks.yaml` that outlines what we want the agents in our crew to do...

- So let's create a file called `tasks.yaml` at the exact location given to us by the error...

- https://docs.crewai.com/getting-started/Start-a-New-CrewAI-Project-Template-Method/#tasksyaml
- `touch src/our_crew_of_agents/config/tasks.yaml`

And paste in this config for the tasks we want the agents in our crew to perform...

```
write_declaration:
    description: >
      Write the Declaration of Independence for the United States during the Revolutionary War.
    expected_output: >
      The Declaration of Independence that will be sent to the British government.
    agent: thomas_jefferson

military_strategy:
    description: >
      Generate a military strategy to defeat the British Army.
    expected_output: >
      A detailed military strategy that will lead the U.S. to victory
    agent: george_washington
```

Around the time of recording, in October 2024, the official structure for the content of this `tasks.yaml` file follows the structure shown here ...

```
name_of_task:
  description: <TEXT_DESCRIBING_THE_TASK>
  expected_output: <TEXT_DESCRIBING_THE_OUTPUT_THAT_WE_WANT_FROM_THE_AGENT_PERFORMING_THE_TASK>
  agent: <THE_AGENT_THE_WE_WANT_TO_ASSIGN_THE_TASK_TO>
```

The way we let our crew class, or blueprint, know about the tasks outlined in this `tasks.yaml` file is like so...

- Go to the `crew.py` file
- and let's add the following code to our crew class

```.py
@task
def write_declaration(self):
  return Task(
    config=self.tasks_config["write_declaration"],
  )
@task
def military_strategy(self):
  return Task(
    config=self.tasks_config["military_strategy"],
  )
```

Zooming out, we see we're designing our crew to consist of 2 agents that will work together to complete 2 tasks

By default, CrewAI will execute tasks in the order they're listed in the `tasks.yaml` file sequentially from top to bottom

So we can see we're tasking TJ to write us a declaration of independence from the British government...

And after the output is generated by TJ it'll be passed to GW who will generate a detailed military strategy taking into account his own backstory and role as well as the expectations we've outlined in his "expected_output" config

(LOOK CAMERA)

There are more complicated patterns besides sequential execution you can leverage when using groups of agents for achieving your goals BUT you can explore those concepts if interested outside of this video as we're keeping it simple and beginner friendly!

## Try running the crew again

- `python src/our_crew_of_agents/main.py`

- Ok we're now see something different and that's great. That means we fixed the issue related to the missing `task.yaml` file

## Observe the error

- Now we're seeing something related to lack of authorization & invalid OpenAI credentials. I wonder what this could mean...

Dun, Dun, Dun...
