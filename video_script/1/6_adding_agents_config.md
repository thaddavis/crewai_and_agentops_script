- FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/code/src/our_crew_of_agents/config/agents.yaml'

- The way CrewAI is designed requires us to include this file and populate it with the configuration of how each agent in our team or crew works...

- https://docs.crewai.com/getting-started/Start-a-New-CrewAI-Project-Template-Method/#agentsyaml

So let's add this file at this exact location...

- `mkdir -p src/our_crew_of_agents/config`
- `touch src/our_crew_of_agents/config/agents.yaml`

and paste in this config...

```.yaml
george_washington:
  role: >
    American Army General - George Washington
  goal: >
    To lead the American Army to victory in the Revolutionary War.
  backstory: >
    George Washington was born in 1732 in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was
    the first President of the United States and led the American Army to victory
    in the Revolutionary War. He is known as the "Father of His Country".

thomas_jefferson:
  role: >
    American Founding Father - Thomas Jefferson
  goal: >
    To write the Declaration of Independence and help establish the United States
    as an independent nation.
  backstory: >
    Thomas Jefferson was born in 1743 in Shadwell, Virginia. He was the third
    President of the United States and the principal author of the Declaration of
    Independence. He is known for his role in shaping the early government of the
    United States.
```

As of 9-28-2024, the configuration of each agent in this `agents.yaml` file follows the structure shown here ...

```
name_of_agent:
  role: <TEXT_DESCRIBING_THE_ROLE_OF_THE_AGENT_IN_THE_CREW>
  goal: <TEXT_DESCRIBING_THE_GOAL_OF_THE_AGENT>
  backstory: <TEXT_DESCRIBING_THE_BACKSTORY_OF_THE_AGENT>
```

This way of outlining system configuration is extremely common in programming and is called YAML format...

YAML allows you to specify key-value pairs that can be nested as well as lists...

In the context of a .yaml file, the `>` is called a "folded block" symbol and it allows you to write your text on multiple lines instead of one big, long line 

The way we connect this `agents.yaml` config to our crew in the `crew.py` file is like this...

Inside `crew.py` you can see we have what is a called a "class"...

A class in the context of programming is a blueprint for creating things.

To use another cooking analogy...

Imagine a recipe for making an amazing dish. The recipe tells us the ingredients and steps needed to make the dish, but itâ€™s not the actual dish - it's just the instructions for how to make it.

Similarly, a "class" defines the ingredients and components of code. When we pass a class to the interpreter of a particular programming language, for example the Python interpreter, we get runnable code that is based on the blueprint outlined in the class

```
@agent
def george_washington(self):
  return Agent(
    config=self.agents_config['george_washington'],
    verbose=True
  )
@agent
def thomas_jefferson(self):
  return Agent(
    config=self.agents_config['thomas_jefferson'],
    verbose=True
  )
```

And zooming out, we can see that we're designing our crew to consist of 2 agents (gw & tj)

## Let's try running our crew again

- Now that we've defined our agents let's try running them again...

- `python src/our_crew_of_agents/main.py`

- Ok we see something new being spit out which is great. That means we fixed the issue related to the missing `agents.yaml` file

## Observe the error

- FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/code/src/our_crew_of_agents/config/tasks.yaml'

I wonder what this means...

Dun, Dun, Dun...
