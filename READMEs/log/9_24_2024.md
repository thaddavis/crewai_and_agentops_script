# CrewAI + AgentOps Integration video

In this video we'll introduce 2 new tools coming out of the Agent development world

The 1st is CrewAI and the 2nd is AgentOps

CrewAI is a Multi-Agent framework and AgentOps is an Agent Observability tool

CrewAI is one of the leaders in their space as is AgentOps...

If there are companies you would have liked to see on these lists that were left out please leave a comment...

We will now show how YOU can use CrewAI w/ AgentOps FROM SCRATCH

- We will start with an empty project
- Then we'll create a Devcontainer so all our work is done inside of Docker
  - Using a Devcontainer will allow you to easily replicate exactly what you see in this video
  - SO ->IF<- you want to code along, all you'll need to do is install VSCode & Docker on your machine
- After we have our Devcontainer set up, we will then build a super simple CrewAI project using 2 different approaches...
  - 1) First, we will build a CrewAI project manually
  - 2) Second, we will do so using the CrewAI CLI

- After we have a CrewAI project we'll run it to confirm it works √
- Then we will add in AgentOps (in less than 30 seconds)
  - AgentOps allows us to get extra insights into how the agents in our "Crew" are working

- And then finally, we'll go Super Saiyan and DEMO how YOU can customize a CrewAI project for your own purposes
- In the DEMO, we'll make our agents resemble an acclaimed songwriting team that will be tasked with writing a #1 hit and we'll actually produce the song to see what it sounds like :)

Silence is golden...

Here we go from scratch..

## SHOW THE BOILERPLATE DIAGRAM

root/
├── .devcontainer/
│   └── devcontainer.json
└── Dockerfile.dev

mkdir .devcontainer
touch .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
touch Dockerfile.dev

## Populate `devcontainer.json`

```devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "CrewAI + AgentOps",
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "../Dockerfile.dev"
  },
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
        "extensions": [
            "ms-python.python",
            "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
            "ms-python.black-formatter",
            "ms-python.debugpy",
            "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker",
            "shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced"
        ],
        "settings": {}
    }
  },
  "forwardPorts": [],
  "workspaceMount": "source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/code,type=bind,consistency=delegated",
  "workspaceFolder": "/code",
  "runArgs": []
}
```

## Populate `Dockerfile.dev`

```.Dockerfile.dev
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /code # set the working directory
COPY .vscode/launch.json ./.vscode/launch.json
ENV PYTHONPATH=/code
```

Alrighty, now that we have these files added we can launch our Devcontainer like so...

SHIFT + COMMAND + P -> `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

To gloss over the details, we are now in another computer running on our computer. Inception type ish. We can play around with CrewAI in this machine, close it when we're done, and then our base machine will be clean as if nothing ever happened.

Let me know in the comments if you like this approach. I find it helps me stay organized.

Let's run a quick test and make sure we are looking good.

```.py
python --version
touch main.py
echo "print('Hello World')" > main.py
python main.py
```

√

```.py
rm main.py
```



- Highlight how CrewAI out of the box does NOT track several important details about what is happening, for example:
  - How fast (or slow) is my crew?
  - What is the exact cost of running my crew?
  - What is the failure rate of my crew?

- Hence, this is where AgentOps comes into the picture...
- AgentOps is an Agent observability tool. As you get deeper into developing ane/or leveraging LLMs and Agents for custom use cases you'll find a tool like this very useful...

- Using AgentOps is SUPER easy. All we have to do is add an API key to our project and initialize the AgentOps client and the entry point of our program...

- We will add the AGENTOPS_API_KEY as an environment variable
  - For those just learning this stuff this means that we create a special separate file that holds our API keys so that we can share the 
  - API keys are how 3rd party platforms like OpenAI or AgentOps identify you so if someone were to steal
